       Air-gapped LLMs on consumer-grade hardware 


<p align="center">


Built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) and [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) and hard-forked from [Imartinez](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) üëÄ



# Environment Setup

In order to set your environment up to run the code here, first install all requirements:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, download the 2 models and place them in a folder called `./models`:
- LLM: default to [ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin). If you prefer a different GPT4All-J compatible model, just download it and reference it in `privateGPT.py`.
- Embedding: default to [ggml-model-q4_0.bin](https://huggingface.co/Pi3141/alpaca-native-7B-ggml/resolve/397e872bf4c83f4c642317a5bf65ce84a105786e/ggml-model-q4_0.bin). If you prefer a different compatible Embeddings model, just download it and reference it in `privateGPT.py` and `ingest.py`.

## Test dataset
This repo uses a [state of the union transcript](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT/blob/main/source_documents/state_of_the_union.txt) as an example.

## Instructions for ingesting your own dataset

Get your .txt file ready.

Run the following command to ingest the data.

```shell
python ingest.py <path_to_your_txt_file>
```

It will create a `db` folder containing the local vectorstore. Will take time, depending on the size of your document.
You can ingest as many documents as you want by running `ingest`, and all will be accumulated in the local embeddings database. 
If you want to start from scracth, delete the `db` folder.

Note: during the ingest process no data leaves your local environment. You could ingest without an internet connection.

## Ask questions to your documents, locally!
In order to ask a question, run a command like:

```shell
python privateGPT.py
```

And wait for the script to require your input. 

```shell
> Enter a query:
```

Hit enter. You'll need to wait 20-30 seconds (depending on your machine) while the LLM model consumes the prompt and prepares the answer. Once done, it will print the answer and the 4 sources it used as context from your documents; you can then ask another question without re-running the script, just wait for the prompt again. 

Note: you could turn off your internet connection, and the script inference would still work. No data gets out of your local environment.

Type `exit` to finish the script.

## How does it work? üëÄ
Selecting the right local models and the power of `LangChain` you can run the entire pipeline locally, without any data leaving your environment, and with reasonable performance.

- `ingest.py` uses `LangChain` tools to parse the document and create embeddings locally using `LlamaCppEmbeddings`. It then stores the result in a local vector database using `Qdrant` vector store.

- `privateGPT.py` uses a local LLM based on `GPT4All-J` to understand questions and create answers. The context for the answers is extracted from the local vector store using a similarity search to locate the right piece of context from the docs.
- `GPT4All-J` wrapper was introduced in LangChain 0.0.162.
